# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running the project locally

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    First, you need to install all the necessary packages. Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the development server:**
    Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with this command:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will start the application on your local machine, typically at `http://localhost:9002`.
